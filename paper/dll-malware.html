  <h1>DLL Hijacking: The Bad Self-Confidence</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) are essential components in software development, especially in Windows environments, as they allow the sharing of code and data among multiple programs, promoting modularity and code reuse. They save disk space and memory and facilitate software maintenance and updates. However, this same flexibility can be exploited by malware creators, who use DLLs to execute malicious code without the user's knowledge, infiltrating systems, stealing data, and maintaining persistent access to compromised networks.</p>

<h1>How a DLL Works</h1>
<p>DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) are designed to allow multiple programs to share common functionalities, promoting software modularity and efficiency. They contain executable code, resources, and data that can be accessed by various programs simultaneously. When a program needs a specific function or resource residing in a DLL, it makes a call to this library, loading it into memory only once, even if multiple programs use it. This saves system resources and reduces redundancy.</p>

<h1>Structure and Functioning</h1>
<p>A DLL is similar to an executable (EXE) but cannot be run directly. Instead, it is loaded and used by other executables or DLLs. It has an export table, which lists all the functions and resources available to other programs, and an import table, which specifies which functions and resources from other DLLs or executables it utilizes.</p>

<p>The image above illustrates how a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) works:</p>
ㅤ
<p>- Programs: There are two programs depicted (Program 1 and Program 2) that require specific functionalities.</p>
ㅤ
<p>- DLL: The DLL itself contains executable code, resources, and data that are shared among multiple programs.</p>
ㅤ
<p>- Arrows: These arrows signify that both programs make calls to the DLL in order to utilize its functionalities.</p>
ㅤ
<p>- Export Table: This table lists all the functions and resources that are available for other programs to use.</p>
ㅤ
<p>- Import Table: This table specifies which functions and resources from other DLLs or executables the current DLL utilizes.</p>

<h1>What is DLL Hijacking?</h2>
<p>DLL Hijacking is an attack where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious version. This attack exploits the way programs search for and load the necessary DLLs. Typically, programs first look for DLLs in the current working directory before checking system directories. An attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name as the legitimate DLL in the directory where the program is executed. When the program attempts to load the DLL, it loads the malicious version, allowing the attacker to execute malicious code in the context of the target program, potentially gaining control of the system.</p>

<h2>Search for the DLL</h2>
<p>- Original DLL: When executed, the application needs additional functionalities provided by a DLL.</p>
  
<p>- DLL Search: The application tries to load this necessary DLL. Usually, the application specifies only the DLL name (e.g., lib.dll) and not the full path.</p>

<h2>Malicious DLL</h2>
<p>- Malicious DLL: An attacker places a malicious DLL in a directory where Windows searches for DLLs before checking the correct directory where the legitimate DLL should be. The idea is that Windows will load the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate DLL due to the directory search order.</p>
  
<p>- DLL Name: The malicious DLL is named the same as the legitimate DLL that the target application is looking for. For example, if the application looks for lib.dll, the attacker will also name their malicious DLL as lib.dll.</p>

<h2>Execution of Malicious Code</h2>
<p>- DLL Loading: When the target application tries to load library.dll, Windows first finds the malicious DLL in the search directory before finding the legitimate DLL in the correct directory.</p>
  
<p>- Code Execution: Windows loads the malicious DLL into the target application's process. This allows the malicious code contained in the DLL to execute within the context of the legitimate application.</p>

<h2>Malicious Actions</h2>
<p>- Data Capture: The malicious code can perform various harmful actions, such as capturing sensitive data like passwords, credit card information, etc.</p>
  
<p>- System Control: It can also take control of the system, execute arbitrary commands, modify important system files, among other harmful actions.</p>
